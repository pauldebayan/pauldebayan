## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Debayan Paul. Welcome to my Github!

I have experience as a Full Stack Developer in a Startup. In the Startup I used to work with technologies like VueJS, ReactJ, NodeJS, PostgreSQL and other Technologies.

> I have started my transition to ML after I came to know about [Devin.ai](https://preview.devin.ai/) which is a "AI software developer". It is not as good a it was branded but I can see the potential of AI which is behind it.

# Following are the **ML platforms** I use:
